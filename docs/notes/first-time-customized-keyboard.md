At the company, my programming equipment consists of a MacBook Pro (M1) with an HP external monitor. I have always used the built-in keyboard of my MacBook for work. However, as the complexity of business applications continues to increase, every time I do programming and development work, I will start many applications in my operating environment, such as single-page applications built by React, BFF applications built by Egg.js, Xcode mobile simulators, and packet capture tools.

As the number of applications opened increased and the computer load became heavier, I gradually noticed that the physical temperature of the MacBook was getting higher and higher, and it even felt hot when using the built-in keyboard. At this time, I realized that I might need an external keyboard.

## Choice

When I found that I needed an external keyboard, I was struggling whether to buy a set of keyboards directly from the manufacturer or customize one of my own.

When I searched for productivity tool recommendations about keyboards on the Internet, the most recommended one was Logitech's MX series. As we all know, Logitech has always been a top manufacturer in the keyboard and mouse ecosystem. It not only has powerful multi-device connection and switching capabilities, but its more prominent features are its unique high-precision sensors and stable wireless connections. And it is more ergonomic in design and workmanship. It not only provides a comfortable touch, but also greatly improves work efficiency.
Its battery life is also outstanding. It can replenish enough power for the device during a short break and continue to work. Even in an emergency situation where the power is exhausted, it can be quickly restored to use.

### MX MECHANICAL MINI

In the Logitech series, [MX MECHANICAL MINI](https://www.logitech.com/zh-cn/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical-mini.html) was almost my favorite target at that time.

> But the only downside is that it only has three axis options: red axis, blue axis, and brown axis. And it doesn't seem to support hot swapping.

When I was still hesitating whether to buy [MX MECHANICAL MINI](https://www.logitech.com/zh-cn/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical-mini.html), another keyboard came into my sight.

### Happy Hacking Keyboard

[Happy Hacking Keyboard ](https://happyhackingkb.com/), abbreviated as HHKB. His slogan is that the Happy Hacking keyboard is the perfect keyboard for professionals in every aspect from key switches, size, structure to layout, providing ultimate durability and comfort.

It uses Electrostatic Capacitor Technology.

**Capacitive switch**, its principle is that after pressing the key, the induction circuit detects the change in the electrostatic capacitance value between the electrodes to determine the trigger. The feel of the capacitive keyboard mainly comes from the elastic silicone bowl, and the conical spring provides auxiliary support.

Because there is no friction of physical contacts, the service life will be longer, and the recognition response speed will be faster, and the noise will be better controlled. Different brands of capacitive keyboards also have different pressure grams. The smaller the pressure grams, the lighter the feel. For example, the pressure grams of HHKB capacitive keyboards are basically 45g, while Realforce Ranfeng capacitive keyboards provide different types of products such as global 30g, global 45g, and partition pressure. The feel of the capacitive keyboard is more inclined to the softness of the red axis, with a slight sense of paragraph, but more subtle than the paragraph of the tea axis.

> In fact, I like this keyboard very much, but its price is not within my budget, so I don't consider it.

### Customization

My first experience with a customized keyboard was through a colleague's office keyboard. He shared with me the process of making his keyboard and recommended me the bilibli video he imitated.

The most basic customized keyboard is actually very simple. There are three main important parts that you can assemble into a finished product, namely the keyboard kit, the shaft body, and the keycaps.

You can choose different manufacturers and different styles for these three settings. As long as they are suitable, you can put them together into a complete keyboard. It has unlimited combinations and can create a variety of keyboards.

I believe that most boys cannot resist the temptation of assembling a keyboard directly by hand, just like the charm brought by Lego.

### Be determined

I struggled for a long time before choosing a customized keyboard. I couldn't get rid of the charm of customization. This was my first time to enter the circle of customized keyboards, and it was also a test of my waters.

You don't know until you touch it. In fact, customization technology is now very mature, and major manufacturers also have separate equipment for sale.

### Keyboard Kit

In fact, when choosing a keyboard set, I recommend that you first confirm the size mode of your keyboard. For example: full size, 87 keys, 84 keys, 61 keys, etc.

After the size is selected, it is the mode of the keyboard set. For example: three-mode, dual-mode, single-mode, etc.

> The mode here refers to the keyboard's connection mode, which supports wired, Bluetooth or 2.4GHz wireless technology.

First determine these necessary requirements, and then choose the kits of manufacturers that meet the conditions for comparison. This greatly narrows the scope of selection and can better help us clarify our goals.

My current choice is the **Black Jishe DK84 three-mode keyboard kit**, which can be easily found on Taobao, JD.com and other major e-commerce platforms in China.
The reason I chose it is that its price is not high, even a little cheap, and it supports three-mode connection.
In fact, in addition to traditional keyboard keys, keyboards from other manufacturers have their own unique special key designs, and some have knob functions. But for my personal aesthetics, I still prefer traditional keyboard designs and don’t like the existence of these special keys. So exclude them all. If you don’t hate this design, you can consider trying it, maybe it will become a helper for your office.

### Axis selection

There are various types of switches in the market, and it is popular to classify them by the sound of keyboard keys. For example: mahjong sound, snow-stepping sound, etc. They are also classified by the touch of the keys. For example: linear switches, paragraph switches, etc. They are not limited to traditional switches such as red, black, green, and tea.

I personally prefer to have silent switches, and they will not disturb others during daily office use. Between linear switches and paragraph switches, I chose linear switches, which will not feel an obvious resistance change point when pressing, and the resistance is relatively uniform during the straight up and down pressing process.

When I was clear about my switch needs, I went to major video sharing websites to learn from the evaluation videos of various bloggers. Compare the differences.

In the end I chose the [Kailh Deep Sea Series - Island Linear Axis]().

### Keycap

Regarding the customized keyboard, I want to design my own keycap design. But none of the designs I have come up with so far have impressed me. So the keycaps are still in the design stage.

So the keycaps of my first customized keyboard were removed from the previous mechanical keyboard. :)

### Besides

Here I would like to share a customization website that I think is pretty good, [zfrontier](https://www.zfrontier.com/app/collection/keycap). In it, you can browse the customization solutions shared by others, which may provide good inspiration for your customization.

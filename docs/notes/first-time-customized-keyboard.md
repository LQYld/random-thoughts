At the company, my programming equipment consists of a MacBook Pro (M1) with an HP external monitor. I have always used the built-in keyboard of my MacBook for work. However, as the complexity of business applications continues to increase, every time I do programming and development work, I will start many applications in my operating environment, such as single-page applications built by React, BFF applications built by Egg.js, Xcode mobile simulators, and packet capture tools.

As the number of applications opened increased and the computer load became heavier, I gradually noticed that the physical temperature of the MacBook was getting higher and higher, and it even felt hot when using the built-in keyboard. At this time, I realized that I might need an external keyboard.

## Choice

When I found that I needed an external keyboard, I was struggling whether to buy a set of keyboards directly from the manufacturer or customize one of my own.

When I searched for productivity tool recommendations about keyboards on the Internet, the most recommended one was Logitech's MX series. As we all know, Logitech has always been a top manufacturer in the keyboard and mouse ecosystem. It not only has powerful multi-device connection and switching capabilities, but its more prominent features are its unique high-precision sensors and stable wireless connections. And it is more ergonomic in design and workmanship. It not only provides a comfortable touch, but also greatly improves work efficiency.
Its battery life is also outstanding. It can replenish enough power for the device during a short break and continue to work. Even in an emergency situation where the power is exhausted, it can be quickly restored to use.

### MX MECHANICAL MINI

在罗技的系列中，[MX MECHANICAL MINI](https://www.logitech.com/zh-cn/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical-mini.html)。几乎是我当时最心仪的目标。

> 但是唯一不足的地方是它只有红轴、青轴、茶轴3款轴体可供选择。并且似乎它并不支持热插拔。


当我还在纠结到底是否入手 [MX MECHANICAL MINI](https://www.logitech.com/zh-cn/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical-mini.html) 的时候，另一款键盘进入了我的视野。

### Happy Hacking Keyboard

[Happy Hacking Keyboard ](https://happyhackingkb.com/)，缩写是 HHKB。他的标语是，Happy Hacking 键盘从按键开关、尺寸、结构到布局的各个方面都是专业人士的完美键盘，提供极致的耐用性和舒适性。

它采用 Electrostatic Capacitor Technology。

**静电容轴体**，其原理是在按下按键后，感应电路检测到电极之间静电容量值的变化从而判定触发。静电容键盘的手感主要来源于弹力硅胶碗，锥形弹簧则提供辅助支撑。

由于没有了物理触点的摩擦，使用寿命会更加长久，而且识别响应速度更快，噪音也控制得更好。不同品牌的静电容键盘还有不同压力克数的配置，压力克数越小，手感越轻，例如 HHKB 静电容键盘的压力克数基本都是 45g，而 Realforce 燃风静电容键盘则提供了全局 30g、全局 45g 以及分区压力等不同类型的产品。静电容键盘的手感表现更加偏向于红轴的轻柔，带有一点轻微的段落感，但比茶轴的段落感更细微。

> 其实我本人对这个键盘的中意程度也很高，但是它的价格并不在我的预算范围之内。所以我不在考虑它。


### Customization

My first experience with a customized keyboard was through a colleague's office keyboard. He shared with me the process of making his keyboard and recommended me the bilibli video he imitated.

The most basic customized keyboard is actually very simple. There are three main important parts that you can assemble into a finished product, namely the keyboard kit, the shaft body, and the keycaps.

You can choose different manufacturers and different styles for these three settings. As long as they are suitable, you can put them together into a complete keyboard. It has unlimited combinations and can create a variety of keyboards.

I believe that most boys cannot resist the temptation of assembling a keyboard directly by hand, just like the charm brought by Lego.


### Be determined

I struggled for a long time before choosing a customized keyboard. I couldn't get rid of the charm of customization. This was my first time to enter the circle of customized keyboards, and it was also a test of my waters.

You don't know until you touch it. In fact, customization technology is now very mature, and major manufacturers also have separate equipment for sale.

### Keyboard Kit

In fact, when choosing a keyboard set, I recommend that you first confirm the size mode of your keyboard. For example: full size, 87 keys, 84 keys, 61 keys, etc.

After the size is selected, it is the mode of the keyboard set. For example: three-mode, dual-mode, single-mode, etc.

> The mode here refers to the keyboard's connection mode, which supports wired, Bluetooth or 2.4GHz wireless technology.

First determine these necessary requirements, and then choose the kits of manufacturers that meet the conditions for comparison. This greatly narrows the scope of selection and can better help us clarify our goals.

My current choice is the **Black Jishe DK84 three-mode keyboard kit**, which can be easily found on Taobao, JD.com and other major e-commerce platforms in China.
The reason I chose it is that its price is not high, even a little cheap, and it supports three-mode connection.
In fact, in addition to traditional keyboard keys, keyboards from other manufacturers have their own unique special key designs, and some have knob functions. But for my personal aesthetics, I still prefer traditional keyboard designs and don’t like the existence of these special keys. So exclude them all. If you don’t hate this design, you can consider trying it, maybe it will become a helper for your office.

### Axis selection

There are various types of switches in the market, and it is popular to classify them by the sound of keyboard keys. For example: mahjong sound, snow-stepping sound, etc. They are also classified by the touch of the keys. For example: linear switches, paragraph switches, etc. They are not limited to traditional switches such as red, black, green, and tea.

I personally prefer to have silent switches, and they will not disturb others during daily office use. Between linear switches and paragraph switches, I chose linear switches, which will not feel an obvious resistance change point when pressing, and the resistance is relatively uniform during the straight up and down pressing process.

When I was clear about my switch needs, I went to major video sharing websites to learn from the evaluation videos of various bloggers. Compare the differences.

In the end I chose the [Kailh Deep Sea Series - Island Linear Axis]().

### Keycap

Regarding the customized keyboard, I want to design my own keycap design. But none of the designs I have come up with so far have impressed me. So the keycaps are still in the design stage.

So the keycaps of my first customized keyboard were removed from the previous mechanical keyboard. :)

### Besides

Here I would like to share a customization website that I think is pretty good, [zfrontier](https://www.zfrontier.com/app/collection/keycap). In it, you can browse the customization solutions shared by others, which may provide good inspiration for your customization.
